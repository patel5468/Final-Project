1. How does the perturbed ensemble variance vary with time relative to the reference ensemble's variance?
    The reference variance plots are more elongated compared to the perturbed variance. For the perturbed ensemble, there is a small increase over time from the start date to the end date. 
    The reference ensemble increases variance immediately and stays relatively constant at each level throughout the entire time period. Level 6 exibits a change from increasing, reaching a maxima
    and then decreasing once again. 


2. For each SPEEDY model variable, for each spatial scale band and for each model level, how many days did it take for the perturbed ensemble's variance to saturate?
    Which of spatial scale's ensemble variance saturates first? Which spatial scale's ensemble variance saturates last?
