1. How does the perturbed ensemble variance vary with time relative to the reference ensemble's variance?
    


2. For each SPEEDY model variable, for each spatial scale band and for each model level, how many days did it take for the perturbed ensemble's variance to saturate?
    Which of spatial scale's ensemble variance saturates first? Which spatial scale's ensemble variance saturates last?
